# Limitations

Written to be read before the results, not after them.

## The environment is a simplification, in specific ways

**There is no arm.** The MuJoCo hand is a free body dragged by a mocap weld.
No joint limits, no self-collision, no arm inertia, no singularities, no
reachability constraint. Every one of those is a real failure mode in a real
cell. A policy trained here needs a reachability check and a joint-limit clamp
between it and any servo loop.

**The hand cannot rotate — by default.** The pads close along world *x*, so a
square box at 45° of yaw presents √2 times its side and above roughly 27 mm of
half-size it is ungraspable at the worst yaw regardless of the policy. Object
sizes are therefore capped at 24 mm half-size, and at that cap yaw cannot bind.

`make_env(..., wrist=True)` adds the yaw degree of freedom (34-D observation,
5-D action), and the honest summary is that it helps the *scripted* policy and
defeats the *learned* one. On boxes spanning 15–35 mm, the expert with a wrist
roughly doubles success in the bands where alignment matters (0.167 → 0.333 at
27–31 mm). Trained from scratch on the same distribution, 200 000 steps, three
seeds:

| | per-seed | mean |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| no wrist (4-D) | 0.333, 0.033, 0.000 | 0.122 |
| with wrist (5-D) | 0.000, 0.000, 0.000 | **0.000** |

Adding the degree of freedom made the task unlearnable at this budget. That is
not mysterious and it is not a bug: the reward has no term for yaw alignment.
`w_align` penalises *lateral offset*, not orientation mismatch, so nothing in
the reward tells the policy that turning the wrist first is worth anything —
the extra dimension is pure exploration cost with no gradient to follow. The
scripted expert benefits because it was *told* to align.

The fix is a reward term, which means redesigning the shaping rather than adding
a joint, and [reward-design.md](reward-design.md) is already explicit about how
much of this task's behaviour came from the shaping rather than the algorithm.
Recorded as measured rather than fixed.

**Objects are boxes.** One shape, randomised in size, mass and friction. No
cylinders, no bottles, no bags, no clutter, no bin. Nothing here demonstrates
grasp *selection* — choosing where to grasp an unfamiliar shape — which is what
most of the grasping literature is actually about.

**The policy is handed the object pose.** No camera, no point cloud, no
detector. The sensing randomisation adds Gaussian noise to a ground-truth pose,
which is a weak model of a real pose estimator: its error is correlated across
steps, biased by viewpoint, and worst when the gripper occludes the object.

**The reward is dense and hand-designed.** Nothing here shows RL discovering
grasping from a sparse signal; a sparse version of this task wants hindsight
experience replay and a much larger compute budget than a CPU afternoon.
[docs/reward-design.md](reward-design.md) is explicit about the two shapings
that failed before the current one worked.

## The results are honest but small

**Five seeds.** Enough to report a t interval across seeds instead of an
anecdote; not enough for a tight one. Where two conditions overlap, this
repository says they overlap rather than picking the favourable framing.

**200 000 steps per run.** Chosen so the whole grid finishes in a few hours on
eight cores. It is not enough for SAC from scratch under randomisation, and the
results say so rather than quietly extending the budget for the conditions that
needed it.

**The from-scratch runs have an entropy-collapse failure mode, and it is now
fixed.** The seeds that stall settle
at an entropy coefficient around 0.025 while the seeds that solve the task sit
near 0.17. A floor under that coefficient rescues all five seeds at half the
budget (0.993 mean, 95% t [0.975, 1.000], against 0.400 and [0.000, 1.000]
without it). The investigation, including the hypothesis that turned out to be
wrong, is in [exploration.md](exploration.md).

**The fix has a hyperparameter, and the hyperparameter does not transfer.** A
floor beats no floor at every randomisation level, but the value that does it is
different for each: `none` needs at least 0.10 and fails at 0.05, `low` needs at
most 0.05 and scores 0.000 at 0.15, `medium` and `high` are indifferent between
them. The 0.15 that rescues the nominal world takes `low` to zero — it stops the
policy learning to grasp at all. So "clamp the entropy coefficient" is a real
fix for a real failure mode and *not* a setting that can be copied between
distributions, which is the most transferable thing this repository learned and
the least convenient.

Getting there took three wrong turns, all recorded in
[exploration.md](exploration.md): the floor looked inert at a matched 100 000
steps, then decisive against an unmatched baseline at 300 000 against 200 000,
then harmful at `low` when only one floor value had been tried there.

The original grid is kept and the floored grid sits beside it, at the same
200 000-step budget: `none` goes from 0.402 to 0.986 on a fixed evaluation,
`medium` from 0.220 to 0.582, `high` from 0.122 to 0.390. Read the un-floored
rows as what a standard SAC configuration does here, not as the best this
algorithm can do on this task.

Fixing the collapse does **not** fix transfer. The floored policies score 0.000
to 0.006 on `shifted`, the same as the un-floored ones, so the poor transfer in
this repository is not an artefact of an undertrained baseline — which is the
first thing one would want to check before believing it.

**One task.** Lift-and-hold, one hold point, one box shape.

**`shifted` is a proxy, not a robot.** See [sim-to-real.md](sim-to-real.md). No
hardware was involved at any point.

## The Isaac Lab port works, but produces no headline number

It was brought up against Isaac Sim 5.1.0 and Isaac Lab 2.3.2 on an RTX 4060,
and all seven of its bring-up checks now pass at both `none` and `medium`
randomisation. That includes the one the port exists for: the reward computed
inside Isaac on the GPU agrees with the shared numpy implementation to about
5e-08 on the same states, so "it is the same task" is measured rather than
asserted. Randomisation is driven through Isaac's event manager from the same
JSON ranges, with the same interval arithmetic.

What it does *not* do is produce any number quoted in the README's headline
tables; every success rate there was produced in MuJoCo. It does now carry its
own five-seed grids: from scratch against demonstration-seeded on the nominal
world (0.000 against 0.969), the entropy floor against its control (0.194
against 0.463, t = 1.01 — not separated), and a randomised grid at `medium`
(0.275 [0.182, 0.368] at 4 000 steps, 0.131 [0.000, 0.272] at 15 000), and two
floor sweeps. The randomised runs get *worse* with more training, and the
mechanism is now known without the cause being known: the entropy coefficient
collapses to 0.0011 and critic loss grows twentyfold, and clamping the
coefficient prevents the critic blow-up on every seed while making success worse
(0.010 against 0.131, Welch t = −2.33). A real, linked, fixable pair of symptoms
that is not what makes randomisation expensive here.

The floor result turned around once the value was swept rather than assumed.
Carrying MuJoCo's 0.15 across gave 0.463 against a 0.194 control and read as a
failed replication; at 0.30 it is 1.000 on three seeds of three, t = 4.71 — the
largest effect in this repository. Both engines therefore show the failure and
the fix, and the value belongs to the distribution: 0.05 at MuJoCo's `low`, 0.15
at MuJoCo nominal, 0.30 here, with 0.05 scoring zero here.

All eleven MuJoCo-side randomisation parameters that predate this work are
mapped in Isaac; the two sensing parameters added since (obs_noise_rot,
obs_noise_corr) are MuJoCo-only. Two of the mapped eleven are
*analogues* rather than translations and are labelled as such: hand compliance
is the `solref` of a MuJoCo weld that has no counterpart here, so it maps to the
arm's joint stiffness with the sign inverted; and gravity is per-scene in Isaac
rather than per-environment, so all environments share one draw where MuJoCo
takes one per episode. Same intervals, coarser granularity. The mapping table is
in `envs/isaac/README.md` rather than quietly omitted.

**Cross-simulator transfer has been measured properly, and it is poor.** Twenty
policies — five seeds at each of four randomisation levels — run in Isaac with
no adaptation score 0.05 to 0.08, with every interval including zero, against
1.000 for the scripted expert in the same environment. No randomisation level
helps reliably.

The first version of this measurement used one seed per level and appeared to
show wide randomisation transferring at 0.41–0.50. It does not: that was seed 0
of `high`, and the other four seeds scored zero. The single-seed reading was
wrong in exactly the way this repository warns about everywhere else, which is
why the five-seed version replaced it.

## Things that would be next, in order of value

1. **A reward term for yaw alignment.** The wrist degree of freedom now exists
   and the scripted expert uses it, but a policy trained with it scores 0.000
   against 0.122 without it: `w_align` penalises lateral offset and nothing
   rewards turning the wrist, so the extra dimension is exploration cost with no
   gradient. The joint was the easy half.
2. Measured randomisation ranges from real hardware. The guessed ones have now
   been checked against published measurements rather than defended
   ([randomisation-sources.md](randomisation-sources.md)): they are optimistic
   on latency by 2-5x, optimistic on sensing, and omitted orientation error
   altogether. Real hardware would still be better than a literature survey.
3. Perception: a wrist camera and a pose estimator in the loop, with its real
   error model rather than additive Gaussian noise.
4. More object shapes, and grasp-point selection.
5. **Why cross-simulator transfer fails.** The evaluation exists and the answer
   is not a control-gain constant — seven scalings of the action, in both
   directions, none of which clears its interval. Halving lateral commands alone
   raises peak lift to what a successful MuJoCo policy reaches while success
   does not move, which points at contact rather than reaching, with one
   supporting number.
6. A sparse-reward variant with hindsight experience replay, to show the task
   can be learned without hand-designed shaping.
